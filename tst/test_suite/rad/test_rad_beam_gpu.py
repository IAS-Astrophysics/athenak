Radiation beam with AMR + tetrad test

rad_beam problem generator first tests tetrad forms orthonormal basis in CKS for BH with
spin a = -0.9.

Then it runs a propagating beam test with the source at the photon ring orbit. This script
reads a 1D x2-slice at x1=2.4 of the final result to check that AMR has followed the
curved beam properly.
